# Navigating-the-MIRACL (Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic C++ Library) -Library in Ubuntu
Having spent so much resources trying to figure out how to install this MIRACL tool, I eventually got the step-by-step approach which made me to post it here. Requirements: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and an Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. Afterwards, we run our first program using the MIRACL header ".h" folder in CPP. 
If you have enough space on your machine, you can install the "Ubuntu" directly rather than using a the Virtual Machine specified earlier. 
Users are also expected to know basic commands in "Linux" for crerating a directory and/or locating a folder e.g. "ls", "cd", "clear" and so on. 
Users should also note that Linux is case-sensitive; therefore, a wrong character will affect the result.
